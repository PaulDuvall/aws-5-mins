[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) delivers a stream of real-time events. To process these events, you can define an event rule with event patterns that define how to filter these events. It it matches the event pattern, the event is sent to a target (or targets) you define in the rule. You can configure these event rules to filter on certain Config Rule events and run remediations via Systems Manager Documents.
