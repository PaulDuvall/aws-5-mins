@todo: How it Works

# CloudFormation Support

## Launch CloudFormation Stack

1. Launch a Cloud9 Environment in **us-east-1** using these [instructions](https://github.com/PaulDuvall/aws-5-mins/tree/main/cloud9).
1. Create an empty YAML file.

```
mkdir ~/environment/my-aws-5-mins
cd ~/environment/my-aws-5-mins
touch audit-manager.yml
```

1. Copy the contents from **[audit-manager.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulDuvall/aws-5-mins/main/audit-manager/audit-manager.yml)** to your local **audit-manager.yml** file in Cloud9 and save it. 
1. Run this command to launch a CloudFormation stack that generates an Audit Manager assessment. 

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name aws-5-mins-auditmanager --template-body file://audit-manager.yml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --region us-east-1
```
